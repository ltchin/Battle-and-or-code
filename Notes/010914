Going over more pathing algorithims
- Record list of tiles that have already gone through and don't want to go backwards
	- Will upload online
	- ArrayList of MapLocations that previously gone to
		- If want to avoid self, don't go on self (keeping snail trail small)
		- Make sure space going is not adjacent to slime trail you're going
- Use this for local while breadth-first for long distance?
- coarsening
	- Don't really need to specify from point to point
	- Make map coarser by dividing by big map
		- Factor how many voids in these big squares

- Promise that maps will never have maps (i.e. corridors one wide), so coarsening is ok
	- Do it with heuristic of where are the voids and where are the euclidean distance
		- Still can have problems though

Print statements take a long time :P

DON'T SHOOT AT HQ

Rip off cheesy pathing algorithim for now while Eric works

Much other files, very clean
